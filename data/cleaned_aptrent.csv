This unique home is featured in ""NorCalMod"", a book on Mid-Century Modern architecture!  This steel frame home has walls of glass and is built on top of two steel I-Beams that rest ABOVE a creek ... yes, the creek runs under the home! The home was designed by Beverly David Thorne, the last living architect to have participated in Arts & Architecture's famous Case Study Houses (1945-1966), a project to introduce modern architecture to the public. He designed houses, most on steep hillsides and built out of steel. He is most famous for the ""Brubeck House"" that was featured on the Ed Sullivan show. With the exception of updated flooring, appliances and the downstairs addition, this house is in its original condition. The steel construction design of the home gives it incredible strength and durability. This also allows the support of glass walls which provide an outstanding view of majestic trees and a garden setting from the front as well as inspiring views of the Bay, San Francisco, the Golden Gate Bridge and Mount Tampalias from the back. When it rains, you can also witness a breath taking creek that flows magnificently under the house. The architecture of this home is what stands out. It is considered a ""floating"" home design and it feels like you are living mid air. Deer come frequently to enjoy the land and add to the serene and inspiring aura of this property. There is a meandering walkway to the front of the home which parallels the creek which provides a zen like peaceful feeling when entering the property.  ACCOMODATIONS This house is a 2014 square foot, 4+ bedroom, 2 bathroom single family home. In addition, there is 1200 square feet of decking to relax and enjoy the views! There are beds in three of the bedrooms plus one extra room. The master bedroom has a king bed with a high-end organic European Sleepworks mattress and a private bathroom. The second room has a queen bed (also European Sleepworks), and the third room has a full size futon bed. There is an additional room downstairs that includes a twin (European Sleepworks) bed. Please note, the downstairs space has no door separating this area from the upper level, only a spiral staircase. However, it still feels very private and boasts amazing creek and forest views. Second bath is on main level and has shower over tub. The main room is an open-concept living room/dining room/kitchen area. It boasts incredible views and has plenty of room for great conversations, working, or just relaxing. Furnishings include a large Z Gallerie soft leather sectional, authentic Starbucks velvet lounge chairs, and a dining table which seats up to 8 (possibly more if requested ahead of time). Front room has a 52"" TV with Blue Ray player and unlimited access to Hulu and Netflix. The master bedroom TV has Hulu and Netflix as well. The kitchen is stocked with all the basics needed for cooking and serving and includes a Bosch dishwasher to make clean-up easier. If you anticipate a need for a certain appliances ahead of time, please let us know and we will do our best to accommodate you. THE NEIGHBORHOOD  Located near the Berkeley hills, the house is in a great location. Minutes from the freeway, UC Berkeley, Tilden Park, and San Francisco. We are close to shopping, restaurants, BART, coffee shops, movie theaters ... everything you may need. We are currently working on a list of places to go, where to eat, and other information about the area. This home is part of the Kensington School District and has one of the top rated Elementary Schools in the Bay area. PARKING/TRANSPORTATION  There is room for 3 cars in the carport driveway as well as plenty of free parking on the road in front of the home.

Built on a grand scale and designed on two levels, this elegant house-like residence is perched high above vibrant Castro Street near 22nd Street atop the ridge separating the Castro from Noe Valley, simultaneously overlooking both Noe and Eureka Valleys, and the downtown SF skyline, as well as looking out over the top of beautiful Liberty Hill.Additional remodeling to the exterior and interior of the building was just completed in May 2014, for a modern, updated and sophisticated look!Pets OK and Welcome!Massive Room Dimensions are approximately as follows:Living/Dining Room - 35' x 14' (enlarging to 20' wide in main living room area)Family Room - 24' x 19'Master Bedroom - 20' x 16'Master Bathroom - 18' x 9' or so at widest point2nd Bedroom - 18.5' x 11.5'3rd Bedroom - 16.5' x 11.5'This large grand home is ideal both for entertaining guests, or simply enjoying the privacy afforded by the separate living areas on opposite ends of the home. Opportunities abound to reallocate some of the space as a 5th bedroom or private sleep area for guests.All bedrooms are about 50% larger than typical.  Even the smallest bedroom is the size of a typical master. The open, flowing floor plan is ideal for hosting or simply retreating to the family room to enjoy the sweet garden outlook. Some of the many specialized features of this home include a gourmet kitchen, nine and a half foot ceilings, custom bookshelves, and both gas and wood-burning fireplaces. The Master Bedroom has sweeping views, as well as a generous double closet and Master Bath. The striking hallway with illuminated, built-in glass shelves leads to the two large rear bedrooms, each of them stepping out to a charming rear patio. The property is semi-detached offering abundant natural light throughout, especially in the living room with its new gas fireplace. The front of the living room extends out far beyond neighboring homes, allowing panoramic views from both the front and sides of the living room that take in downtown SF and Eureka Valley on the left, Liberty Hill and beautiful Victorians across the street, and Noe Valley and the Bay to the right. The formal dining room and living room in the front of the home are grand in scale and design and connect seamlessly, making this home perfect for entertaining.  Gorgeous deep brown walnut hardwood floors were recently installed in the living room, dining room, family room, master bedroom, and hallway, instilling a sense of grandeur and elegance throughout. The gourmet kitchen was remodeled in 2009 and features gorgeous granite countertops, maple cabinets, hi-end Thermador refrigerator and appliances, and an attractive new tiled floor, and opens to the rear family room. The large family room in back of the home, with a 60-inch Pioneer big screen TV and balcony, overlooks a serene flowering garden and is ideal for contemporary urban living. An attractive wine bar was added in 2010. The separation between the living room in front and the family room in back provides for simultaneous entertainment and living opportunities - entertain guests in one room, while other family members relax in another, with virtually complete privacy. The family room is up to twice the size of a typical family room and has ample room for guests to stay overnight or for more extended periods of time. The master bedroom has sweeping views of Downtown, Eureka Valley, and the neighboring Victorian Ladies. There is also generous closet space and a tiled master bath with separate tub and stall shower.  Another big screen TV is included here. The two rear bedrooms are nicely separated from the Master by a long, elegant hallway, with built-in illuminated glass shelves.  Both rear bedrooms have large closets and walkout access to the rear patio.  This home has a top of the line LG washer and dryer.  The home comes optionally semi-furnished with sofa sectionals in the living and family rooms, a lovely dining room table with chairs, and two beds, as well as various cabinets, carpets, and lamps and tables.  You may keep as much or as little as you wish. This house-like residence is perched high above the FLAT block of vibrant Castro Street on top of the ridge which makes walking into and out of the building and its vicinity very easy -- no steep streets to deal with!  You can even stroll around Castro, 22nd, Noe, and Hill streets and it's nearly all flat which makes for a great walk!  It is also a 7-minute walk down to 18th St, and a 5-minute walk down to 24th St.Enjoy the convenient access of Muni (bus stop on end of same block, just 1 door down!) and also an elevator that brings you from street level to near the front door, so you can enjoy those amazing views without having to walk up the hill from 18th or 24th streets, or walk up numerous flights of stairs.New aluminum garage doors were installed in 2013 and look great!  Dedicated garage space optional for $300/mo.Building is Built on rock, making it much safer during an earthquake.In addition to all of this, convenient street parking is available in the very same block around 90% - 95% of the time during the day and early evening, one of the rare desirable neighborhoods in the City where this is the case.  Usually several spaces are available within 75 feet of the front door.

We had looked at several apartments in the area in the same price range and size. When we came here the apartment seemed to be a lot bigger than the other apartments we looked at. It was also slightly cheaper. We figured it was a no brainer. Kayla did mention the apartment we looked at was not the one we were getting but it was exactly the same. We asked to look at the apartment before we signed the lease. We weren't able to because the current tenants were still in it. This seemed fine at the time, but I would not recommend it. I came to see our apartment the day we were scheduled to move in. As soon as Kayla opened the door, I could tell the apartment was smaller. I mentioned this Kayla, and her response was ""Really? I thought it was bigger?"" Right then I knew we had been dooped. I could tell just in the tone of her voice. Everything was smaller. The living room, bathroom, bedroom and closet.  The closet was really obvious. The unit we had been showed had 3 sides of the closet to hang clothes and ours only had 2. It wasn't big enough to have 3. The closet door would not have been able to open. The outdoor balcony was about 3/4 the size of the apartment we looked at. The out closet wasn't even half of the one we saw. I was pretty upset and let Kayla know we didn't want this apartment. It wasn't the same as the one we looked at. Kayla just said I could talk to her manager, Monica, about canceling our lease. I spoke with Monica and in a very rude (bitchy) tone, told me we could cancel, but with a 3-month cancelation fee. I tried bringing up the size difference and she didn't respond. She completely ignored what I was saying and said blatantly told us if he wanted to canceled we could but we would have to pay 3 months rent as a cancelation fee. This whole sequence was bizarre. Not once did Kayla or Monica try to help the situation or assure us that was the same size apartment. I tried asking to look at the apartment we looked at, but of course it was rented. We already signed the lease and weren't about to pay 3 month penalty to get out of our lease. That would have been over $6k. They knew that had us right where the wanted us. Nothing we could do at this point. We didn't really expect to get the used car salesman approach here, but that's exactly what we got. On their website, you'll see they have 2 different 1bd apartment floor plans that are identical, A1 and A2. The only difference is about 71 sqft. Kayla had initially showed us the 776 sqft unit and rented us the 705sqft unit. The ol bait and switch!! 71 sqft is about an 8ftx8ft room. Now imagine if you walked in to your place and there was 8x8 room missing. Pretty obvious, right? But if you took a foot or 2 off of each room? That is a lot harder to notice. I spotted before I took one step into that apartment. It wasn't even close. Kayla maintains the complex does not have the A2 floor plan on the 2nd floor because it has an attached garage. The apartment we initially looked at the one we moved in were on the 2nd floor. They must have an A2 model unit on the 2nd floor they show people. I repeatedly asked to see that model or any other A2 model. I was always told there weren't any available. We never were able to look at the A2 model for comparison. I wonder why?!?!Now that we've gotten their shadiness out of the way. There are a few other reasons why you may want to reconsider moving here. The model unit we looked at, had stainless steel appliances. At first glance our apartment had them as well. Until I looked closer. They are same old appliances they have used for at least 5-10 years. All they do, is remove the face covers and put stainless covers on. Once you openthem you can tell how old they are. Pretty clever if you think about it. I didn't catch it until a couple weeks after we moved in. The city of Dublin will be working on Dougherty Rd through 2018. The main entrance is on Dougherty and impossible to get out of the apartment in the morning or evening. It could take you a good 10 minutes to turn out in either direction. DO NOT move into any unit in building 5, 6 or 7. Right across the street are 3 auto shops, open 6-7 days a week. Unless you like coming home to relax, listening to the sounds of power tools and cars whipping donuts, do not move here.  Trust us, you can hear everything. The complex is dog friendly, which is great! Unless you have a dog starting yelping like its getting beat every night at 10pm. The complex is 3 stories. If you don't live on the third floor, get used to hearing everything from your neighbors above. It's crazy how thing the floors are. We have a lady with 2 kids above us. When there home, its none stop. It sounds like there's a WWF match going above us. Also, if you're moving into a unite on the 1st or 2nd floor, look at the apartments above you. If they have a pad lock on the door, I wouldn't move into it. They use these for temporary housing. You'll have people moving in and out all the time. These people don't typically care about the noise since they can't really be evicted. Its impossible to relax when we are home. Who wants to work 12 hrs a day and come home to that every day? Complaints to the leasing office go through one ear and out the to other. Don't bother. Their solution was to pay more per month and move up to the third floor. What a joke. We are in apartment 6206. Do not sign a lease for that unit. You WILL regret it!! If you have, you better ask to look at it before. I'm not sure if they can make you sign a lease before seeing the unit you're moving into. I wish we would have thought of that. This property is managed by Greystar. One quick search on the Better Business Bureau website and you'll see they have a F -- rating. No surprise there. There are plenty of other nice options in the area. This place seems great on the surface. Save yourself the headache and don't even bother coming here. If you do, at least you'll know what to look for and break and tape measure!! I wish we have.  I will say the pool/bqq and gym are pretty nice. That's about it.","1BR / 1Ba704ft2 data-date=""2017-01-09"" data-today_msg=""지금 가능"">가능 1월 9</p>"

It's a 3 bedroom, 1 bath with a large backyard and attached one car garage with W/D hook ups in the garage. Quiet neighborhood. We've been here for about 9 Months. A few things that I'm going to tell you upfront: 1) The property manager is really hard to get a hold of; it's almost impossible to get her to fix things. Her philosophy is to do the least possible work. 2) The backyard is quite large but there is gravel about 4"" deep so don't plan on having a garden or lawn in the back. 3) She is very uptight about her standards, so excellent credit, rental history and income verification will be needed. Evictions will not be considered.Why am I telling you this upfront? Because the rent is about $250/Mo less than it's worth to make up for it; but I don't want you to waste your time or mine. My wife and I are in the process of moving out and we are looking for someone to move in as soon as possible. If you are interested, please send me the following:1) What you're currently paying for rent and why you're moving2) Household income3) When you're looking to move4) Contact infoAny emails that just say ""Is the house available"" or ""I would like to see the house"" will be ignored. If we have a tenant accepted, we will take the ad down. Applications will be presented as they come, so first come first serve.
